# HFX
This tool is used within the old cluster of the AuP-team. It was probably
forked and modified a couple of years ago, but was lost at some point in time.
To keep the used tools working within the new cluster it was forked again from
https://github.com/siyanew/HFX.git and small fixes were applied. This repo
is referenced in a dockerfile coming from the lma-k8s project. It will be
dropped at some point in the future, but as of now it is needed within the
new cluster.
